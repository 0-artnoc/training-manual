### Activity: Creating a New File

Now it is time to create the skeleton of your recommendation file:

1. Create a new file with the following file name `YOUR-USERNAME-YOUR-HOMETOWN.md`. For example, `githubteacher-san-francisco.md`.
1. Add a skeleton for your file with the following lines:
  - `# HOMETOWN recommendations`
  - `## Great Places to Eat`
  - `## Fun Things to Do`
1. *Save* your file.

> **Note:** Git doesn't care how you work with your files locally. You can work in your favorite IDE or text editor, or you can create the file on the command line with `touch FILENAME.md` or `echo "Starter content" > FILENAME.md`.
