Congratulations! You should now have a working version of Git and a text editor on your system. If you still have some time before class begins, here are some interesting resources you can check out:

- *github.com/explore* Explore is a showcase of interesting projects in the GitHub Universe. See something you want to re-visit? Star the repository to make it easier to find later.
- *services.github.com/on-demand* Our On Demand Training courses are GitHub's open source training materials. The site contains additional resources you may find helpful when reviewing what you have learned in class! You can even make contributions to the materials or open issues if you would like us to explain something in greater detail. Find the open source repository here: `https://github.com/github/training-kit`
