### Introduction to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages enable you to host free, static web pages directly from your GitHub repositories. Several of the projects we use in class will use GitHub Pages as the deployment strategy. We will barely scratch the surface in this class, but there are a few things you need to know:

- You can create two types of websites, a user/organization site or a project site. We will be working with project websites.
- For a project site, GitHub will only serve the content on a specific branch. Depending on the settings for your repository, GitHub can serve your site from a `master` or `gh-pages` branch, or a `/docs` folder on the `master` branch.
- The rendered sites for our projects will appear at `githubschool.github.io/repo-name`.
