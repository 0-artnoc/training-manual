### Reset Soft

Using the practice repository we created earlier, let's try a `reset --soft`.

.Activity Instructions
. Use the log alias `git lol` to look at the history of our project.
. Identify the current location of `HEAD`.
. We want to go back two commits in our history so we will type `git reset --soft HEAD~2`.
. Using `git lol`, we can see the tip of our branch (and `HEAD`) is now sitting two commits earlier than it was before.
. Type `git status`. The changes we made in the last two commits should be in the staging area.
. Go ahead and re-commit these changes with `git commit -m "re-add file 5 and 6"`.

[NOTE]
====
In this example, the tilde tells git we want to reset to two commits before the current location of `HEAD`. You can also use the first few characters of the commit ID to pinpoint the location where you would like to reset.
