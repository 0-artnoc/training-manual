=== Discussion Guide: Team Workflows

Here are some topics you will want to discuss with your team as you establish your ideal process:

1. Which branching strategy will we use?
2. Which branch will serve as our "master" or deployed code?
3. Will we use naming conventions for our branches?
4. How will we use labels and assignees?
5. Will we use milestones?
6. Will we have required elements of Issues or Pull Requests (e.g. shipping checklists)?
7. How will we indicate sign-off on Pull Requests?
8. Who will merge pull requests?
