## How to Generate Jekyll Sites Locally

The repositories we use in class are deployed using GitHub Pages, so you don't _need_ to do any local serving.

But, if you'd like to see what your changes look like locally before they actually are pushed to the default branch, you can. Here's how:

1. Clone the repository, and CD into it
1. Once inside of the repository, type `script/setup` to install all of the proper gems.
1. Then, type `script/server`.
1. If all goes well, your terminal will tell you where to access your site in your browser.
