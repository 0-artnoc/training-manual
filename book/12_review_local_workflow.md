## Review Local Workflow

To get some more practice with the GitHub Flow, you'll find several open issues in the class 'Caption This' repository. You can find them by looking at the project, or the issues tab.

Each issue has instructions on how to complete an activity. Find one of the open issues, and leave a comment to let the rest of the team know that you plan on working on it. 

Follow the steps of the GitHub flow:
- Create a branch.
- Make commits on the new branch.
- Open a pull request with `base: master` and `compare: YOUR_BRANCH`.
- Collaborate!  
  - Ask for help on your pull request.
  - Help others on their pull requests.
  - Possibly make more commits.
- Merge your pull request. :tada:
