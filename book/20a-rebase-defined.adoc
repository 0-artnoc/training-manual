### About Git rebase

The `git rebase` command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository. You can reorder, edit, or squash commits together.

Typically, you would use`git rebase` to:

- Edit previous commit messages
- Combine multiple commits into one
- Delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary

[WARNING]
====
Because changing your commit history can make things difficult for everyone else using the repository, it's considered bad practice to rebase commits when you've already pushed to a repository.

#### Rebasing commits against a point in time
