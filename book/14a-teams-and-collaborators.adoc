### User Accounts vs. Organization Accounts

There are two major account types in GitHub, user accounts and organization accounts. While there are many differences in these account types, on of the more notable differences is how you handle permissions.

User Accounts:: Our first class repository was in a user account for GitHub Teacher. Permissions for a user account are simple, you simply add people as collaborators to give them full read-write access to the project.
Organization Accounts:: Organization accounts provide more granular control over repository permissions. In an organization account you will create teams of people and then give those teams access to specific repositories. You can also designate the type of access a team should have (e.g, read only, read-write, or admin).
