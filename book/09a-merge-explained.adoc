### Merge Explained

When you merge your branch, you are taking the content and history from your feature branch and adding it to the content and history of the `master` branch.

[NOTE]
====
Many project teams have established rules about who should merge a pull request.

- Some say it should be the person who created the pull request since they will be the ones to deal with any issues resulting from the merge.
- Others say it should be a single person within the project team to ensure consistency.
- Still others say it can be anyone other than the person who created the pull request to ensure at least one review has taken place.

This is a discussion you should have with the other members of your team.
