When you merge your branch, you are taking the content and history from your feature branch and adding it to the content and history of the `master` branch.

[NOTE]
====
Many project teams have established rules about who should merge a pull request. Some say it should be the person who created the pull request since they will be the ones to deal with any issues resulting from the merge. Others say it should be a single person within the project team to ensure consistency. Still others say it can be anyone other than the person who created the pull request.
