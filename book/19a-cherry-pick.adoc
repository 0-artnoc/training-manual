[[_cherry-pick]]
=== You Just Want That One Commit

Cherry picking allows you to pick up a commit from one branch of the project and move it to your current branch. Right now, your file directory and log should look like this:

[source,console]
----
$ ls
README.md
$ git lol
84nqdkq initializing repo with README
----

Let's try it:

1. Create and checkout to a new branch named `cherry-picking`.
2. Using the reflog, find the commit ID where you added file2.md.
3. Type `git cherry-pick <SHA>`.

Now when you view your directory and log, you should see:

[source,console]
----
$ ls
file2.md
README.md
$ git lol
eanu482 init file 2
84nqdkq initializing repo with README
----

Is the commit ID the same as the one you used in the cherry pick command? Why or why not?
