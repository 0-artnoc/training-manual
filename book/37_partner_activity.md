## Partner activity: Create a failing PR ~60-75 minutes

#### Part 1: Working on another repository
- Partner up with another participant (logistics?) and add their repository as another remote to your own local repo
- Go to their project and look at their `.yml` file. What is some code that would cause a pull request to fail based on their tests?
- Follow the GitHub flow to open a pull request introducing commits that will cause the tests to fail on your partner's repository

#### Part 2: Back in your own repository
- Find the pull request in your own repository that has a failing build status
- Use build output to figure out why the build is breaking
- Review the pull request formally with recommendations on what to change so that the build will pass

#### Part 3: In your partner's repository
- After your partner has reviewed your pull request, make the changes they suggest (whether or not you think they are correct).

#### Part 4: In your own repository
- When the build is passing, merge the pull request and celebrate :tada:
