In some workflows, it might be valuable to set up protections to avoid accidental mistakes and/or risky shortcuts. There are several methods for this, including **Protected Branches** and **Code Owners**.

### Protected Branches


### Code Owners
Repository maintainers can define exactly which people and teams need to review projects by creating a code owners file.

This feature automatically requests reviews from the code owners when a pull request changes any owned files.
