| Step    | Description
| 1       | Click the Issues tab.
| 2       | Click *New Issue*
| 3       | Type a subject line for the issue.
| 4       | A `-` followed by a space and `[ ]` will create a handy checklist in your issue or pull request.
| 5       | When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.
| 6       | A `#` followed by the number of an issue or pull request (without a space) in the same repository will create a cross-link.
| 7       | Tone is easily lost in written communication. To help, GitHub allows you to drop emoji into your comments. Simply surround the emoji id with `:`.
