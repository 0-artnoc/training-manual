## Changing the `.yml` file

#### Introduce Changes to the `.yml` File

We've created more tests on the in the `/tests` directory. Let's go through the process of adding a new test, and seeing what it's like to break it or test it.

1. If you look in the `tests/` directory, you'll see a few new tests. We're going to add the `tests/speedmax.rb` test to the `.yml` file.
1. Create a new branch based on `gh-pages`.
1. On that branch, open the `.yml` file. Add `tests/speedmax.rb` to the file in the same place that the other test, checking the URL, is being run.
1. Create a pull request.
1. Review the contents of the new test. What do you think it does? Why would we implement it? What could we do differently? When will it pass or fail?
1. Merge the pull request.
