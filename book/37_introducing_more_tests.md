## Introduce More Tests

As you can see in the `tests/` directory, there are many more tests you can add to the `.yml` file. What do you think they do? What kind of tests would you write to ensure this game is working properly?

#### More changes to `.yml` file

Using the GitHub Flow that we've used throughout class, add more tests to the `.yml` file.

Feel free to use tests in the `tests/` directory, or if you'd like, write your own! If you do write your own, be sure that the error message is clear enough so that developers know how to fix what's broken.
