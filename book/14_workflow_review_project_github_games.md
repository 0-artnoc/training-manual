## Workflow Review Project: GitHub Games

In this section, we will work on a project repository called `github-games`.

You can access the class repository at `https://github.com/githubschool/github-games`.

First, let's compare and contrast this project with the one we used in the previous activity:

- This repository is owned by an organization called githubschool
- This repository will be rendered as a website by GitHub Pages
- This repository does not have a master branch. Instead, it has a default branch called gh-pages.
