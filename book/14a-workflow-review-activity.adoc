### Workflow Review: Updating the README.md

First, let's practice the GitHub Flow from beginning to end by updating the link in the README to point to your fork of the repository.

We have intentionally left these steps very high level since they are a review. If you need help with any of these steps, refer to the earlier section of this manual:

.Workflow Review Activity
. Clone your fork of the repository locally.
. Create a new branch called `readme-update`.
. Make changes to the README.md.
. Commit the changes to your branch.
. Push your branch to GitHub.
. Create a Pull Request *in your repository*.
. Merge your changes.
. Delete the branch.
. Update your local copy of the repository.
