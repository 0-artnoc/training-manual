### Creating a Linear History

One of the most common uses of rebase is to eliminate recursive merges and create a more linear history. In this activity, we will learn how it is done.

.Git Rebase.

.Activity Set Up
. Use `git lol` to find the SHA of the initial commit.
. `git reset --hard SHA`.
. `git checkout -b rebase-me`.
. Use `git reflog` to cherry-pick files 4-6 onto your rebase-me branch.
. `git checkout master`.
. Use `git reflog` to cherry-pick files 1-3 onto your master branch.
. Take a look at your history with `git lol`. If you merged now, it would be a recursive merge.

.Begin the Rebase
. Type `git checkout rebase-me`.
. Start the merge by typing `git rebase -i master`.
. Your text editor will open, allowing you to see the commits to be rebased.
. Save and close the `rebase-todo`.
. Watch your rebase happen on the command line.
. Take another look at your history with `git lol`. If you merged now, it would be a fast-forward merge.

.Finish the Merge
. Get ready to merge your branches by typing `git checkout master`.
. Merge your changes in to master by typing `git merge rebase-me`.
