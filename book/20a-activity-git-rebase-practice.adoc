### Creating a Linear History

One of the most common uses of rebase is to eliminate recursive merges and create a more linear history. In this activity, we will learn how it is done.

.Git Rebase.

.Activity Set Up
. Find the SHA of the initial commit: `git log --oneline`
. Reset to the SHA of the initial commit: `git reset --hard SHA`
. Create a new branch and check out to it: `git checkout -b rebase-me`
. Cherry-pick files 4-6 onto the `rebase-me` branch using the reflog.
. Checkout to master: `git checkout master`
. Cherry-pick files 1-3 onto the `rebase-me` branch using the reflog.
. Look at your history: `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`
. If you merged now, it would be a recursive merge.

.Begin the Rebase
. Checkout to the `rebase-me` branch: `git checkout rebase-me`
. Start the merge: `git rebase -i master`
. Your text editor will open, allowing you to see the commits to be rebased.
. Save and close the `rebase-todo`.
. Watch your rebase happen on the command line.
. Take another look at your history: `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`
. If you merged now, it would be a fast-forward merge.

.Finish the Merge
. Checkout to master, the branch you will merge into: `git checkout master`
. Merge your changes in to master: `git merge rebase-me`
