### Exploring a Pull Request

Now that we have created a Pull Request, let's explore a few of the features that make Pull Requests the center of collaboration:

Conversation view:: Similar to the discussion thread on an Issue, a Pull Request contains a discussion about the changes being made to the repository. This discussion is found in the Conversation tab and also includes a record of all of the commit that have been made on the branch.
Commits view:: The commits view contains information about who has made changes to the files. Each commit is an updated view of the repository, allowing us to see how changes have happened from commit to commit.
Files changed view:: The Files changed view allows you to see the change that is being proposed. We call this the `diff`. Notice that some of the text is highlighted in red. This is what has been removed. The green text is what has been added.

#### Code Review in Pull Requests

To provide feedback on proposed changes, GitHub offers two levels of commenting:

General Conversation:: You can provide general comments on the Pull Request within the *Conversation* tab.
Line Comments:: In the files changed view, you can hover over a line to see a blue `+` icon. Clicking this icon will allow you to enter a comment on a specific line. These line level comments are a great way to give additional context on recommended changes. They will also be displayed in the conversation view.
