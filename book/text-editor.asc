=== Setting Up Your Text Editor

For this class, we will use a basic text editor to interact with our code. Let's make sure you have one installed and ready to work from the Command Line.

==== Pick Your Editor

You can use almost any text editor, but we have the best success with the following:

* https://atom.io/[atom]
* Vi or Vim
* Sublime
* Notepad or Notepad++

If you do not already have a text editor installed, download and install one!

==== Your Editor on the Command Line

Once you have installed an editor, confirm you can open it from the command line. This requires you to have Shell Commands installed on atom. For example, for atom, you would type the following to open the current directory in atom:

[source,console]
----
$ atom .
----

==== Editor Configuration

(((git commands, config)))Finally, let's configure your favorite text editor to work with Git.

[source,console]
----
$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
----

Just in case atom isn't your favorite, this help article contains instructions for several other editors: https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/[]
