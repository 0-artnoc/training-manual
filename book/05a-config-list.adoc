### Viewing Your Configurations

[source,console]
----
$ git config --list
----

If you would like to see which config settings have been added automatically, you can type `git config --list`. This will automatically read from each of the storage containers for config settings and list them.

[source,console]
----
$ git config --global --list
----

You can also narrow the list to a specific configuration level by including it before the list option.
