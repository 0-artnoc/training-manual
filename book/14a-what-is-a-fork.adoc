### What is a Fork?

A fork is a full copy of a repository that resides on a different account. They are easiest to understand in the context of Open Source, but are also commonly used in organizations to control who can merge a pull request. Essentially, you will use a fork to make changes to a repository when you do not have write access. At the moment you create the fork, it is an exact duplicate of the parent repository.
