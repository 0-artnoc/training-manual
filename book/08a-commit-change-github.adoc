### Committing Changes on GitHub

Once you have made some changes to your file, you will need to create a new commit.

Scroll to the bottom of the file editor to find the commit message field.

The commit message should describe what was changed in the present tense. For example, Add favorite color.

Since we accessed our file through the pull request, GitHub helpfully directs us to commit our changes to the same branch. Choose the option to `Commit directly to your branch` and click `Commit changes`.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to see what was changed in a specific commit, you can go to the Commits tab and click on the Commit ID you would like to view.
