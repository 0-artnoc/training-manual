### Remote Merge Conflicts

When you created the Pull Request, you should have had a merge conflict. This is because the colors of the shapes had also been changed on gh-pages. Let's use the GitHub Merge Conflicts UI to solve this conflict.

1. Click *Resolve conflict*
- Use *Next* to locate the conflict.
- Decide which version of the colors you will keep.
- Delete the second set of colors and the conflict markers.
- Click *Mark as resolved*
- Click *Commit changes*

> **Note:** Some merge conflicts are too complex to be resolved using the GitHub.com UI. In these cases, the Resolve conflict button will be inactive.

> The *Command line instructions* in the merge dialog box will give you some helpful pointers for how to resolve the conflict locally. *A word of caution*, the command line instructions assume you are ready to merge and close the pull request, so only complete Step 1 of the instructions if you are still collaborating on the changes.
