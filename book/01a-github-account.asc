=== Setting Up Your GitHub Account

For the GitHub for Developer class, we will use a public account on GitHub.com. We do this for a few reasons:

* We don't want you to "practice" in repositories that contain real code.
* We are going to break some things so we can teach you how to fix them. (therefore, refer to #1 above)
* We work very hard to maintain feature parity between GitHub.com and the latest version of GitHub for Enterprise. The user experience should be nearly identical.

==== Create Your Account

1. Access GitHub.com and click Sign up
2. You will receive a verification email at the address provided.
3. Click the link to verify your email address.
