### Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub.com Account

For this class, we will use a public account on GitHub.com. We do this for a few reasons:

- We don't want you to "practice" in repositories that contain real code.
- We are going to break some things so we can teach you how to fix them. (therefore, refer to the bullet above)

If you already have a github.com account you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can set up your free account by following these steps:

. Access GitHub.com and click Sign up.
. Choose the free account.
. You will receive a verification email at the address provided.
. Click the link to complete the verification process.
