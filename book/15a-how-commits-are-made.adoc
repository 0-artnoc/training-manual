### How Commits Are Made

Every commit in Git is a unique snapshot of the project at that point in time. It contains the following information:

- The version of every blob in the repository
- The author of the commit
- The author's email
- The date and time of the commit
- The commit message

Each commit also contains the commit ID of its parent commit.
