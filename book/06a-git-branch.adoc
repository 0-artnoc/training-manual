[[_git_branch]]
=== Using Branches locally

[source,console]
----
$ git branch
----

If you type `git branch` you will see a list of local branches. Notice that the branch you created before you cloned the repository doesn't show up here.

[source,console]
----
$ git branch --all
$ git branch -a
----

If you want to see all of the branches, including the read-only copies of your remote branches, you can add the `--all` option or just `-a`

[NOTE]
====
The `--all` and `-a` are actually synonyms in Git. Git often provides a verbose and a short option.
