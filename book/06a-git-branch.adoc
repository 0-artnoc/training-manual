Facilitator Note: Note that any branches created before the repo has been cloned do not appear with `git branch`.

[source,console]
----
$ git branch --all
$ git branch -a
----

If you want to see all of the branches, including the read-only copies of your remote branches, you can add the `--all` option or just `-a`.

[NOTE]
====
The `--all` and `-a` are actually synonyms in Git. Git often provides a verbose and a short option.
