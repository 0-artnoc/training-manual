### Introduction to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages enable you to host free, static web pages directly from your GitHub repositories. The `github-games` project will use GitHub Pages. We will barely scratch the surface in this class, but there are a few things you need to know:

- You can create two types of websites, a user/organization site or a project site. We are creating a project website.
- For a project site, GitHub will only serve the content on a specific branch. Depending on the settings for your repository, GitHub can serve your site from a `master` or `gh-pages` branch, or a `/docs` folder on the `master` branch.
- The rendered site for your fork will appear at `username.github.io/github-games`.
