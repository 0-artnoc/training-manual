### Git Configuration Levels

![Git Configuration Levels](book/images/config-levels.jpg)

Git allows you to set configuration options at three different levels.

#### --system
These are system-wide configurations. They apply to all users on this computer.
#### --global
These are the user level configurations. They only apply to your user account.
#### --local
These are the repository level configurations. They only apply to the specific repository where they are set.

> **Note:** The default value for git config is `--local`.
