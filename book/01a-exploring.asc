=== Waiting Room

All done with your pre-requisites and waiting for class to get started? Here are some interesting things you can check out while you are waiting:

1. *github.com/explore* Explore is a showcase of interesting projects in the GitHub Universe. See something you want to re-visit? Star the repository to make it easier to find later.
2. *training.github.com/kit* The Training Kit is GitHub's open source training content. The kit contains additional resources you may find helpful later when reviewing what you have learned in class!
