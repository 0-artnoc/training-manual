.Cloning a repository.

Before we can work locally, we will need to create a clone of the repository.

When you clone a repository you are creating a copy of everything in that repository, including its history. This is one of the benefits of a DVCS like git - rather than being required to query a slow centralized server to review the commit history, queries are run locally and are lightning fast.

Let's go ahead and clone the class repository to your local desktop.

.Activity Instructions
. Navigate to the *class repository* on GitHub.
. Copy the *clone URL*.
. Open the CLI.
. Type `git clone <URL>`.
. Type `cd <repo-name>`.
