When you merge your branch, you are taking the content and history from your feature branch and adding it to the content and history of the `master` branch.

Many project teams have established rules about who should merge a pull request. Some say it should be the person who created the pull request since they will be the ones to deal with any issues resulting from the merge. Others say it should be a single person within the project team to ensure consistency. Still others say it can be anyone other than the person who created the pull request.
- There are also third party Continuous Integration (CI) tools you can integrate with GitHub to test the build before the merge is completed. There are pros and cons to each approach and we will not attempt to prescribe a solution here, but these are good conversations to have within your project team.
- Let's take a look at how you can merge the pull request and close the original issue at the same time.


- do: "Add a `:+1:` emoji"
  say: "Most project teams require someone to sign off on the change before it is merged. We like to use emoji to show our approval. In the previous lab you created a file, next you will create a pull request for your file."

      say: "We can use the # to auto-generate the link to the issue."
    - do: "Type a few letters from the issue name"
      say: "Since the issue title contained your username, you can type the first few letters of your GitHub username to narrow down the list of possible issues."
    - do: "Select the correct issue from the drop down"
      say: "Simply select your issue from the list."

      say: "A confirmation message will let you know that your pull request was merged and closed. It also let's you know that the branch we created can be safely deleted."
    - do: "Click `Delete branch`"
      say: "Since we won't be using this branch anymore, you should go ahead and delete it now."
    - do: "Click `Issues` and then filter to see the `Closed` issues"
