### Step 3: Set Up Your Text Editor

For this class, we will use a basic text editor to interact with our code. Let's make sure you have one installed and ready to work from the command line.

#### Pick Your Editor

You can use almost any text editor, but we have the best success with the following:

- https://atom.io/[atom]
- Vi or Vim
- Sublime
- Notepad or Notepad++

If you do not already have a text editor installed, go ahead and download and install one of the above editors now!

#### Your Editor on the Command Line

After you have install an editor, confirm you can open it from the command line. If you are working on a Mac, you will need to Install Shell Commands from the Atom menu, this happens as part of the installation process for Windows.

If installed properly, the following command will open the atom text editor:

[source,console]
----
$ atom .
