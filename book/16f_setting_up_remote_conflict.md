> ## Facilitator Note

> The remote merge conflict in this section is already set up. There will be a conflict even if you do not change anything on the upstream repository.

> This is because the conflict is built into the `shape-colors` branch. There would be a merge conflict if you work with this branch from `origin` remote, as well as from the `upstream` remote.
