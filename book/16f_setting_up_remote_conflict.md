> ## Facilitator Note

> The remote merge conflict in this section is **not** already set up. For this activity to work, the facilitator will need to make changes to the upstream repository during a break.

> 1. Prepare to edit the upstream remote (githubschool/github-games)
> 2. Checkout to the `shape-colors` branch
> 3. Find the `index.html` file
> 4. Change the colors on lines 115 - 121

> Make these changes before adding the remote in class. If you are going to skip the remote portion, the entire class will need to go through making changes on `shape-colors` in their own individual repositories.
