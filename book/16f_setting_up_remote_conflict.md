> ## Facilitator Note

> The remote merge conflict in this section is **not** already set up. For this activity to work, the facilitator will need to make changes to the code on the `shape-colors` branch in `index.html`.

> Make these changes before adding the remote in class. If you are going to skip the remote portion, the entire class will need to go through making changes on `shape-colors` in their own individual repositories.
