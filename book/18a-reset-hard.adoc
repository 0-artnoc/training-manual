### Reset Hard

Last but not least, let's try a hard reset.

. Start by viewing the history of our project.
. This time we reset to the point in time where the only file that existed was the README.md. Type `git reset --hard <SHA>`.
. Type `git status`. Notice your working directory is clean.
. Viewing the history of your project will reveal a single commit.

[WARNING]
====
Remember, `git reset --hard` is a destructive command. Don't use it unless you really want to discard your changes.
