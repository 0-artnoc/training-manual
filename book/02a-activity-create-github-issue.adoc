### Activity: Creating A GitHub Issue

Follow these steps to create an issue in the class repository:

.Activity Instructions
. Click the Issues tab.
. Click *New Issue*.
. Type a subject line for the issue.
. A `-` followed by a space and `[ ]` will create a handy checklist in your issue or pull request.
. When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.
. A `#` followed by the number of an issue or pull request (without a space) in the same repository will create a cross-link.
. Tone is easily lost in written communication. To help, GitHub allows you to drop emoji into your comments. Simply surround the emoji id with `:`.
