Git allows you to set configuration options at three different levels.

- *--system* - These are system-wide configurations. They apply to all users on this computer.
- *--global* - These are the user level configurations. They only apply to your user account.
- *--local* - These are the repository level configurations. They only apply to the specific repository where they are set.

[NOTE]
====
The default value for git config is `--local`.
