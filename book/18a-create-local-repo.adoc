### Creating a Local Repository

Since `git reset` rewrites history, you should avoid using it on commits that have already been made public (e.g. pushed to the repository on GitHub).

To avoid teaching you bad habits, we will create a practice repository. This time, we will start the repository locally, from the command line.

.Activity Instructions
. Navigate to the directory where you will place your practice repo.
. Type `git init practice-repo`.
. Type `cd practice-repo`.
. Create a README.md file and use it as your initial commit.
