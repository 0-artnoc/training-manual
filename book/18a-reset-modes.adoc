### Understanding Reset

Sometimes we are working on a branch and we decide things aren't going quite like we had planned. We want to reset some, or even all, of our files to look like what they were at a different point in history. We can do that with `git reset`.

Remember, there are three different snapshots of our project at any given time. The first is the most recent commit. The second is the staging area (also called the index). The third is the working directory (i.e. whatever you currently have saved on disk). The `git reset` command has three modes, and they allow us to change some or all of these three snapshots.

It also helps to know what branches technically are: each is a pointer, or reference, to the latest commit in a line of work. As we add new commits, the currently checked-out branch "moves forward," so that it always points to the most recent commit.

### Reset Modes

The three modes for git reset are: `--soft`, `--mixed`, and `--hard`. For these examples, assume that we have a "clean" working directory, i.e. there are no uncommited changes.

soft:: `git reset --soft <my-branch> <other-commit>` moves `<my-branch>` to point at `<other-commit>`. However, the working directory and staging area remain untouched. Since the snapshot that `<my-branch>` points to now differs from the index's snapshot, this command effectively stages all differences between those snapshots. This is a good command to use when you have made a large number of small commits and you would like to regroup them into a single commit.
mixed:: With the `--mixed` option, Git makes `<my-branch>` *and* the staging area look like the `<other-commit>` snapshot. This is the default mode: if you don't include a mode flag, Git will assume you want `--mixed`. `--mixed` is useful if you want to keep all of your changes in the working directory, but change whether and how you commit those changes.
hard:: `--hard` is the most drastic option. With this, Git will now make all 3 snapshots, `<my-branch>`, the staging area, *and* your working directory, look like they did at `<other-commit>`. This can be dangerous! We've assumed so far that our working directory is clean. If it is not, and you have uncommited changes, `git reset --hard` will *delete all of those changes*. Even with a clean working directory, use `--hard` only if you're sure you want to completely undo earlier changes.

Next we will try out each of these options.
