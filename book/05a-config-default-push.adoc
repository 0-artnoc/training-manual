### Configuring Default Push Behavior

[source,console]
----
$ git config --global push.default simple
----

One final configuration option we will want to set is our default value for push. When you push changes from your local computer to the remote you can choose whether you want git to automatically push all of the local branches to their matching branches on the remote or whether you only want the currently checked out branch to be pushed. The config setting we use to set this option is push.default. We can set the default to `matching` if we want to push all branches automatically. OR, we can set it to `simple` if we only want to push the branch we are on.
