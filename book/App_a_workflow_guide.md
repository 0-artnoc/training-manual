### Discussion Guide: Team Workflows

Here are some topics you will want to discuss with your team as you establish your ideal process:

1. Which branching strategy will we use?
- Which branch will serve as our "master" or deployed code?
- Will we use naming conventions for our branches?
- How will we use labels and assignees?
- Will we use milestones?
- Will we have required elements of Issues or Pull Requests (e.g. shipping checklists)?
- How will we indicate sign-off on Pull Requests?
- Who will merge pull requests?
