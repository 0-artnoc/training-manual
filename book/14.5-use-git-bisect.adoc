### Git Bisect

.Activity Instructions
. Initiate the binary search: `git bisect start`.
. Specify the commit where you noticed the code was broken: `git bisect bad <SHA>`.
. Specify the commit where you knew things were working: `git bisect good <SHA`.
. As it starts the search, run a test. Our test is to see if an `index.html` file exists, type `ls`.
. If the game is still broken (and there's no `index.html` file), type: `git bisect bad`.
. If the game works (and there *is* an `index.html` file), type: `git bisect good`.
. Exit the bisect process: `git bisect reset`.

*You can also run this test automatically*. Instead of typing `ls`, try typing `git bisect run ls index.html`.
