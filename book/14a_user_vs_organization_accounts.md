### User Accounts vs. Organization Accounts

There are two account types in GitHub, user accounts and organization accounts. While there are many differences in these account types, on of the more notable differences is how you handle permissions.

#### User Accounts
When you signed up for GitHub, you were automatically given a user account. Permissions for a user account are simple, you add people as collaborators to specific repositories to give them full read-write access to the project.
#### Organization Accounts
Organization accounts provide more granular control over repository permissions. In an organization account you create teams of people and then give those teams access to specific repositories. Permissions can be assigned at the team level (e.g, read, write, or admin).
