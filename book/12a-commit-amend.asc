[[_commit_amend]]
=== Changing Commits

Commit amend allows us to fix mistakes in our last commit. Two of the most common uses are:

* Re-writing commit messages
* Adding files to the commit

When you are adding files to the previous commit, the files to be added should be in the staging area when you type the `git commit --amend` command.

You can actually amend any data stored by the last commit such as commit author, email, etc.
