### What is `git bisect`?

Using a binary search, `git bisect` can help us detect specific events in our code. For example, you could use bisect to locate the commit where:

- a bug was introduced.
- a new feature was added.
- a benchmarkâ€™s performance improved.

#### How it works

`git bisect` works by cutting the history between two points in half and then checking you out to that commit. You then check whether the bug/feature exists at that point and tell Git the result. From there, Git will do another division, etc until you have located the desired commit.

[WARNING]
====
When you are doing a bisect, you are essentially in a detached head state. It is important to remember to end the bisect with `git bisect reset` before attempting to perform other operations with Git.
