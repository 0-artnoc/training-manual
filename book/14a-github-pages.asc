=== Introduction to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages enable you to host a free, static web page directly from your GitHub repository. The `github-games` project will use GitHub Pages. We will barely scratch the surface in this class, but there are a few things you need to know:

- You can create two types of websites, a user/organization site or a project site. We are creating a project website.
- For a project site, GitHub will look for a special `gh-pages` branch and only serve the content on that branch.
- The rendered site for your fork will appear at `username.github.io/github-games`.
