  - Partner Merge Conflicts (in-person classes only - skip for online classes) + add -p & git mv
    - **DEMO & LAB:** Instructions -->
     - Partners add each other as collaborators to their forks
     - Partners clone each other's forks (show `git clone <URL> repo-name` to avoid name conflicts)
     - Working on one of the repos, both partners create a branch and make changes to the same files as follows:
      - Add instructions for playing the game to the README.md
      - Change the timing for the game to speed it up or slow it down in index.html
      - Change location of texture.jpg to images/texture.jpg
    - `git status`
    - `mkdir images`
    - `git mv texture.jpg images/texture.jpg`
    - `git status`
    - `git add -p` - stage the change for the image location
    - `git commit`
    - show diff to review other changes - commit the changes
    - `git push` and create Pull Requests
    - one partner merges pull request
    - the other partner will have conflict - resolve the conflict
