#### More changes to `.yml` file ~30-45 minutes
- "Choose your own adventure" of possible ways to change file.
- Options are included on branches `all-travis-tests` and `all-circle-tests`
- Individually, developers adding at least one more test. This can be from templates, but if they want to add their own, that's okay too.
