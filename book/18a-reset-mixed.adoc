### Reset Mixed

Next we will try the default mode of reset, `reset --mixed`:

.Activity Instructions
. Once again, we will start by viewing the history of our project with `git lol`.
. This time we only want to go back one commit in history so we will type `git reset HEAD~`.
. Type `git lol` to see that the tip of branch is not pointing at the commit where we added file 4 again.
. Type `git status`. The changes we made in the last commit have been moved back to the working directory.
. This time, we will need to `git add` the files to the staging area before we can commit them.
. Go ahead and re-commit the files with `git commit -m "re-add file 5 and 6"`.


[NOTE]
====
Notice that although we have essentially made the exact same commit (adding file 5 and 6 together with the same HEAD and commit message) we still get a new commit ID. This can help us see why the reset command should never be used on commits that have been pushed to the remote.
