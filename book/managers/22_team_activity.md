## Real World Team Work

Now, we're going to divide into small teams of 2-3 people. Each team will be assigned an issue from the project board within the original class repository.

### Team Instructions
1. Review the instructions in your given issue
1. Choose one team member to "drive" the initial changes
1. Complete the GitHub flow from end to end
  - Create a branch
  - Make the commit or commits to complete the task on the new branch
  - Open a pull request against `master`
  - Check the tests with Circle CI
  - Check the deployment with Heroku
1. Those who didn't open the pull request, review the pull request
1. Merge the pull request
