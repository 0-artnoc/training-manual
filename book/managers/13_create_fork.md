To practice creating a pipeline, let's set up our own personal workspace. To create our workspace we will [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [github-for-managers](https://github.com/universeworkshops/github-for-managers) repository. A **fork** is effectively a copy of a project you can use to freely experiment without affecting the original project.

1. Navigate to the workshop repository at https://github.com/universeworkshops/github-for-managers.
1. In the top-right-hand corner, click **Fork** [:camera:](https://github.com/universeworkshops/github-for-managers/master/workshop-images/github-for-managers.017.jpeg). If asked, fork to your personal GitHub account.
1. You will then be taken to your forked repository where you can experiment. Notice the `forked from...` message in the top-left, and notice you can now see a **Settings** tab because you are the admin here.

1. Let's protect the master branch. Click the repository's **Settings** tab, then **Branches**. Under **Protected branches** click the dropdown and select `master`. [:camera:](https://github.com/universeworkshops/github-for-managers/master/workshop-images/github-for-managers.019.jpeg)
1. In the **Branch protection for `master`** page, check all available settings. [:camera:](https://github.com/universeworkshops/github-for-managers/master/workshop-images/github-for-managers.020.jpeg)
