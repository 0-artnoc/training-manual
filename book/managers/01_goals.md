## Goals for this course

During our time together, we are going to discuss common workflows on GitHub with hands on walkthroughs of industry software development pipelines from start to finish. GitHub is the platform which connects all of the important tools in your software development lifecycle.

By the end of this course, you'll see that GitHub goes far beyond version control. We'll discuss and dissect different workflows going far beyond version control. This is a very hands on class. After we build a pre-designed workflow ranging from planning to testing to deployment, we'll discuss different workflow challenges and map them out with possible solutions to take back to your teams.
