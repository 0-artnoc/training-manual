## Goals for this course

During our time together, we are going to discuss common workflows on GitHub with hands on walkthroughs of industry software development pipelines from start to finish.

By the end of this course, you'll see that GitHub goes far beyond version control. GitHub is the platform which connects all of the important tools in your software development lifecycle.
