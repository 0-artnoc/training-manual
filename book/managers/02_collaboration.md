## Getting Started With Collaboration

This one-day class leads participants through common situations with GitHub, graphical clients, and file versioning. Participants will learn how to use version control without touching the command line and discover solutions in working with a variety workflows, tools, and user perspectives.

We will start by introducing you to Git, GitHub, and the collaboration features we will use throughout the class. Even if you have used GitHub in the past, we hope this information will provide a baseline understanding of how to use it to build better software!

### The GitHub Ecosystem

Rather than force you into a "one size fits all" ecosystem, GitHub strives to be the place that brings all of your favorite tools together. For more information on integrations, check out https://github.com/integrations.

You may even find some new, indispensable tools to help with continuous integration, dependency management, code quality and much more.
