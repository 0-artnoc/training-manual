Developers should know how to use Git and GitHub on a day to day basis. However, before any team gets started, it's critical to have a defined workflow.

Consider the following scenarios....
  
- GitHub Pages
- Git Flow vs GitHub Flow
- Choosing tools in the development pipeline
- Project Boards &  Milestones
- Templates
- Avoiding context changing
- Using Pulse and Graphs
