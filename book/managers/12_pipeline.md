# Software Development Pipeline

GitHub concepts are well documented features, but it is important to understand how developers do their work. Even new users to GitHub can set up a CI/CD development pipeline with little effort.

A pipeline is a concept of how your tools fit together, so the development process is seamless. The goals are to:
- Provide quick feedback to developers
- Automate as much as possible
- Deploy with higher quality code

These three smaller goals all fit together to accomplish a much larger and more abstract goal: to develop faster and better.
