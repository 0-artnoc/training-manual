Now that you have made some changes and committed them locally, it is time to push them up to the remote. In this case, our remote is GitHub.com, but this could also be your company's internal instance of GitHub Enterprise.

To push your changes to GitHub, you will use the command:

[source,console]
----
$ git push -u origin <branch-name>
----

[NOTE]
====
The `-u` is the short version of the option `--set-upstream`. This option tells Git to create a relationship between our local branch and a remote tracking branch of the same name.
