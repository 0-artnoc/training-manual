[[_commit_amend]]
### Revising Your Last Commit

`git commit --amend` allows us to make changes to the commit that HEAD is currently pointing to. Two of the most common uses are:

- Re-writing commit messages
- Adding files to the commit

.Activity Instructions
. Type `touch file7.txt` to create a new file.
. When you are adding files to the previous commit, they should be in the staging area. Type `git add file7.txt`. 
. Type `git commit --amend`.
. The text editor will open, allowing you to edit your commit message.

[NOTE]
====
You can actually amend any data stored by the last commit such as commit author, email, etc.
