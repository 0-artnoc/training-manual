### Configuring a Default Text Editor

[source,console]
----
$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
----

Next, we will add the default text editor git will use when you need to edit things like commit messages. If you have downloaded and installed the open source text editor atom, the command shown above will configure it properly.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a Mac, you will need to install the shell commands from the Atom menu before the command above will work.

If you would like to use a different editor you can find additional instructions at https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/
