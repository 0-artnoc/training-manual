### Local Merge Conflicts

To practice merge conflicts, we first need to create one. Complete the following:

.Activity Instructions
. Type `git checkout -b stats-update origin/stats-update`
. Type `git diff â€”color-words gh-pages..stats-update`
. Check out the gh-pages branch
. Merge the stats-update branch into gh-pages

You should receive a conflict message similar to the one shown below:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout gh-pages
Switched to branch 'gh-pages'
$ git merge stats-update
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
----

Use `git status` to determine which file(s) are in conflict.

Open the conflicting file in your text editor.

[source,console]
----
<<<<<<<<< HEAD
Some text
=========
Some more text
>>>>>>>>> stats-update
----

.Activity Instructions
. Choose which version of the code you would like to keep
. Remove the conflict markers
. Save the file
. Close the text editor
. Type `git status`
. Type `git add index.html`
. Type `git commit -m "resolving merge conflict"`
