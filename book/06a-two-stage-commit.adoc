### Making Your First commit

After you have finished making your changes, it is time to commit them. When working from the command line, you will need to be familiar with the idea of the two stage commit.

.The Two Stage Commit - Part 1.

When you work locally, your files exist in one of four states. They are either untracked, modified, staged, or committed.

An untracked file is one that is not currently part of the version controlled directory.

.The Two Stage Commit - Part 2.

To add these files to version control, you will create a collection of files that represent a discrete unit of work. We build this unit in the staging area.

.The Two Stage Commit - Part 3.

When we are satisfied with the unit of work we have assembled, we will commit everything in the staging area.

.The Two Stage Commit - Part 4.

In order to make a file part of the version controlled directory we will first do a git add and then we will do a git commit. Let's do it now.

[source,console]
----
$ git add my-file.md
$ git commit
----

When you type the commit command without any options, Git will open your default text editor to request a commit message. Simply type your message on the top line of the file. Any line without a # will be included in the commit message.

#### Tips for Good Commit Messages

Good commit messages should:

- Be short. ~50 characters is ideal.
- Describe the change introduced by the commit.
- Tell the story of how your project has evolved.
