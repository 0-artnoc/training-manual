## Training Manual: Open Source, Online, Asynchronous Resource

As the training-kit has gone away with the new iteration of training.github.com, I think we should open a discussion about what we'd like the open source training resources to look like.

#### User story wish list
- Website that provides asynchronous, staged tutorials for a multitude of courses
- Trainers could update this content and add new courses, ideally syncing with content in this repo's training-manual/book  
- Videos could be embedded
- Images could be embedded
- Presentation keynotes could be utilized, shared, and updated using something like the remark presentations here: https://github.com/github/markdown-presentations
- Materials could be organized different ways, such as only seeing keynotes or by only seeing 'GitHub for Developers' content
- If we build activities in to the training, could we also create a bot to interact with them (e.g. I see you just opened your first issue, congrats)?
- Can we set this page up to collect some basic information from our learners. It would be awesome to learn more about utilization and long term effects?
- User authentication to see facilitator notes, partner specific resources, or certain courses
- Responsive design for our mobile friends
- Embedded interactive elements, like the workflow diagram in guides

#### Examples
- [Outlearn](https://www.outlearn.com/learn/jonathanfmills/advanced-js) has a UX that is smooth and organized, showing current topics in small chunks while still giving users an idea of larger scale of module, unit, and course
- [Docker](https://training.docker.com/self-paced-training) offers a self paced training page that offers similar content, but in a more flexible manner

#### Logistics
- We should think about where it lives. Should it be something that lives on the appliance for our GHE customers?
