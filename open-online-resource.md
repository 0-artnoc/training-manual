## Training Manual: Open Source, Online, Asynchronous Resource

As the training-kit has gone away with the new iteration of training.github.com, I think we should open a discussion about what we'd like the open source training resources to look like.

#### User story wish list
- Website that provides asynchronous, staged tutorials for a multitude of courses
- Trainers could update this content and add new courses, ideally syncing with content in this repo's training-manual/book  
- Videos could be embedded
- Images could be embedded
- Presentation keynotes could be utilized, shared, and updated 
- Materials could be organized different ways, such as only seeing keynotes or by only seeing 'GitHub for Developers' content

#### UX
- [Outlearn](https://www.outlearn.com/learn/jonathanfmills/advanced-js) has a UX that is smooth and organized, showing current topics in small chunks while still giving users an idea of larger scale of module, unit, and course
