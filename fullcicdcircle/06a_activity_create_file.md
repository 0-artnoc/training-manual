### Activity: Edit Your File

Now it is time to put an image and a caption into your file:

1. Find your file, `named 2010-02-##-USERNAME.md`.
1. Open your file in your favorite text editor.
1. Copy and paste the image text into your file on line 6.
1. On line 7, add this text to center the file: `{: .center}`. 
1. On lines 9 and 10, add code for your caption.

        ```
        CAPTION-HERE
        {: .fragment}
        ```
1. *Save* your file.

> Git doesn't care how you work with your files locally. You can work in your favorite IDE or text editor, or you can use VIM through the command line. 

> To open your file from the command line, many IDEs and text editors offer shortcuts. For example, to open the project in Atom, you can use `atom .` and to open it in Visual Studio Code you can use `code .`.
