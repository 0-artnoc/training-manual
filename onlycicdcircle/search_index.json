to GitHub for Developers\n\nNote: This version of the manual is newer, and contains activities from our new curriculum. You can find the legacy version of our training manual here.\n\nYou can download a PDF version of this manual here.\nToday you will embark on an exciting new adventure: learning how to use Git and GitHub.\nAs we move through today's materials, please keep in mind: this class is for you! Be sure to follow along, try the activities, and ask lots of questions!\nLicense\nThe prose, course text, slide layouts, class outlines, diagrams, HTML, CSS, and Markdown code in the set of educational materials located in this repository are licensed as CC BY 4.0.

We do this for a few reasons:\n\nWe don't want you to \"practice\" in repositories that contain real code.\nWe are going to break some things so we can teach you how to fix them. (therefore, refer to the bullet above)\n\nIf you already have a github.com account you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can set up your free account by following these steps:\n\nAccess GitHub.com and click Sign up.\nChoose the free account.\nYou will receive a verification email at the address provided.\nClick the link to complete the verification process.\n\nStep 2: Install Git\nGit is an open source version control application. You will need Git installed for this class.\nYou may already have Git installed so let's check! Open Terminal if you are on a Mac, or PowerShell if you are on a Windows machine, and type:\n$ git --version\n\nYou should see something like this:\n$ git --version\ngit version 2.11.0\n\nAnything over 2.0 will work for this class!\nDownloading and Installing Git\nIf you don't already have Git installed, you can download Git at www.git-scm.com.\nIf you need additional assistance installing Git, you can find more information in the ProGit chapter on installing Git: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.\nWhere is Your Shell?\nNow is a good time to create a shortcut to the command line application you will want to use with Git:\n\nIf you are working on Windows, you can use Git Bash which is installed with the Git package or you can use Powershell with Posh-git.\nIf you are working on a Mac or other Unix based system, you can use the terminal application.\n\nGo ahead and open your command line application now!\nStep 3: Set Up Your Text Editor\nFor this class, we will use a basic text editor to interact with our code. Let's make sure you have one installed and ready to work from the command line.\nPick Your Editor\nYou can use almost any text editor, but we have the best success with the following:\n\nAtom\nGitPad\nVi or Vim\nSublime\nNotepad or Notepad++\n\nIf you do not already have a text editor installed, go ahead and download and install one of the above editors now!\nYour Editor on the Command Line\nAfter you have installed an editor, confirm you can open it from the command line.\nIf installed properly, the following command will open the Atom text editor:\n$ atom .\n\n\nIf you are working on a Mac, you will need to Install Shell Commands from the Atom menu, this happens as part of the installation process for Windows.\n\nExploring\nCongratulations! You should now have a working version of Git and a text editor on your system. If you still have some time before class begins, here are some interesting resources you can check out:\n\ngithub.com/explore Explore is a showcase of interesting projects in the GitHub Universe.

Even if you have used GitHub in the past, we hope this information will provide a baseline understanding of how to use it to build better software!\nWhat is GitHub?\nGitHub is a collaboration platform built on top of a distributed version control system called Git.\n\nIn addition to being a place to host and share your Git projects, GitHub provides a number of features to help you and your team collaborate more effectively. These features include:\n\nIssues\nPull Requests\nProjects\nOrganizations and Teams\n\n\nThe GitHub Ecosystem\nRather than force you into a \"one size fits all\" ecosystem, GitHub strives to be the place that brings all of your favorite tools together. For more information on integrations, check out https://github.com/integrations.\n\nYou may even find some new, indispensable tools to help with continuous integration, dependency management, code quality and much more.\nWhat is Git?\nGit is:\n\na distributed version control system or DVCS.\nfree and open source.\ndesigned to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\neasy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.\n\nGit features cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.\nAs we begin to discuss Git (and what makes it special) it would be helpful if you could forget everything you know about other version control systems (VCSs) for just a moment. Git stores and thinks about information very differently than other VCSs.\nWe will learn more about how Git stores your code as we go through this class, but the first thing you will need to understand is how Git works with your content.\nSnapshots, not Deltas\nOne of the first ideas you will need understand is that Git does not store your information as series of changes. Instead Git takes a snapshot of your repository at a given point in time. This snapshot is called a commit.\nOptimized for Local Operations\nGit is optimized for local operation. When you clone a copy of a repository to your local machine, you receive a copy of the entire repository and its history. This means you can work on the plane, on the train, or anywhere else your adventures find you!\nBranches are Lightweight and Cheap\nBranches are an essential concept in Git.\nWhen you create a new branch in Git, you are actually just creating a pointer that corresponds to the most recent snapshot in a line of work. Git keeps the snapshots for each branch separate until you explicitly tell it to merge those snapshots into the main line of work.\nGit is Explicit\nWhich brings us to our final point for now; Git is very explicit. It does not do anything until you tell it to. No auto-saves or auto-syncing with the remote, Git waits for you to tell it when to take a snapshot and when to send that snapshot to the remote.\nExploring a GitHub Repository\nA repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It is easiest to imagine as a project's folder. However, unlike an ordinary folder on your laptop, a GitHub repository offers simple yet powerful tools for collaborating with others.\nA repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Whether you are just curious or you are a major contributor, knowing your way around a repository is essential!\n\nUser Accounts vs. Organization Accounts\nThere are two account types in GitHub, user accounts and organization accounts. While there are many differences in these account types, on of the more notable differences is how you handle permissions.\nUser Accounts\nWhen you signed up for GitHub, you were automatically given a user account. Permissions for a user account are simple, you add people as collaborators to specific repositories to give them full read-write access to the project.\nOrganization Accounts\nOrganization accounts provide more granular control over repository permissions. In an organization account you create teams of people and then give those teams access to specific repositories. Permissions can be assigned at the team level (e.g, read, write, or admin).\nRepository Navigation\nCode\nThe code view is where you will find the files included in the repository. These files may contain the project code, documentation, and other important files. We also call this view the root of the project. Any changes to these files will be tracked via Git version control.\nIssues\nIssues are used to track bugs and feature requests. Issues can be assigned to specific team members and are designed to encourage discussion and collaboration.\nPull Requests\nA Pull Request represents a change, such as adding, modifying, or deleting files, which the author would like to make to the repository. Pull Requests help you write better software by facilitating code review and showing the status of any automated tests.\nProjects\nProjects allow you to visualize your work with Kanban style boards. Projects can be created at the repository or organization level.\nWiki\nWikis in GitHub can be used to communicate project details, display user documentation, or almost anything your heart desires. And of course, GitHub helps you keep track of the edits to your Wiki!\nPulse\nPulse is your project's dash board. It contains information on the work that has been completed and the work in progress.\nGraphs\nGraphs provide a more granular view into the repository activity, including who has contributed, when the work is being done, and who has forked the repository.\nREADME.md\nThe README.md is a special file that we recommend all repositories contain. GitHub looks for this file and helpfully displays it below the repository. The README should explain the project and point readers to helpful information within the project.\nCONTRIBUTING.md\nThe CONTRIBUTING.md is another special file that is used to describe the process for collaborating on the repository. The link to the CONTRIBUTING.md file is shown when a user attempts to create a new issue or pull request.\nISSUE_TEMPLATE.md\nThe ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md (and its twin the pull request template) are used to generate templated starter text for your project issues. Any time someone opens an issue, the content in the template will be pre-populated in the issue body.\nUsing GitHub Issues\nIn GitHub, you will use issues to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. Issues make collaboration easier by:\n\nReplacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the team has the complete story, both now and in the future.\nAllowing you to cross-link to related issues and pull requests.\nCreating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions.\nAllowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation with @ mentions and team mentions.\n\nActivity: Creating A GitHub Issue\nFollow these steps to create an issue in the class repository:\n\nClick the Issues tab.\nClick New Issue.\nType the following in the Subject line: YOUR-USERNAME Workflow\nIn the body of the issue, include the text below:\n\nYOUR-USERNAME will choose an image, add a caption, and add both to a file.\n\n- [ ] Create a branch\n- [ ] Edit the file\n- [ ] Commit the changes\n- [ ] Create a Pull Request\n- [ ] Request a Review\n- [ ] Make more changes\n- [ ] Get an approval\n- [ ] Merge the Pull Request\n\nUsing Markdown\nGitHub uses a syntax called Markdown to help you add basic text formatting to Issues, Pull Requests, and files with the .md extension.\nCommonly Used Markdown Syntax\n# Header\nThe # indicates a Header. # = Header 1, ##  = Header 2, etc.\n* List item\nA single * or - followed by a space will create a bulleted list.\n**Bold item**\nTwo asterix ** on either side of a string will make that text bold.\n- [ ] Checklist\nA - followed by a space and [ ] will create a handy checklist in your issue or pull request.\n@mention\nWhen you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.\n#975\nA # followed by the number of an issue or pull request (without a space) in the same repository will create a cross-link.\n:smiley:\nTone is easily lost in written communication.

Several of the projects we use in class will use GitHub Pages as the deployment strategy. We will barely scratch the surface in this class, but there are a few things you need to know:\n\nYou can create two types of websites, a user/organization site or a project site. We will be working with project websites.\nFor a project site, GitHub will only serve the content on a specific branch. Depending on the settings for your repository, GitHub can serve your site from a master or gh-pages branch, or a /docs folder on the master branch.\nThe rendered sites for our projects will appear at githubschool.github.io/repo-name.\n\n"},"03_github_flow.html":{"url":"03_github_flow.html","title":"GitHub Flow","keywords":"","body":"Understanding the GitHub Flow\nIn this section, we will discuss the collaborative workflow enabled by GitHub.\nThe Essential GitHub Workflow\n\nThe GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment with new ideas safely, without fear of compromising a project.\nBranching is a key concept you will need to understand. Everything in GitHub lives on a branch. By default, the \"blessed\" or \"canonical\" version of your project lives on a branch called master. This branch can actually be named anything, as we will see in a few minutes.\nWhen you are ready to experiment with a new feature or fix an issue, you create a new branch of the project. The branch will look exactly like master at first, but any changes you make will only be reflected in your branch. Such a new branch is often called a \"feature\" branch.\nAs you make changes to the files within the project, you will commit your changes to the feature branch.\nWhen you are ready to start a discussion about your changes, you will open a pull request. A pull request doesn't need to be a perfect work of art - it is meant to be a starting point that will be further refined and polished through the efforts of the project team.\nWhen the changes contained in the pull request are approved, the feature branch is merged onto the master branch. In the next section, you will learn how to put this GitHub workflow into practice.\nExploring\nHere are some interesting things you can check out later:\n\nguides.github.com/introduction/flow/ An interactive review of the GitHub Workflow.\n\n"},"04_branching_with_git.html":{"url":"04_branching_with_git.html","title":"Branching with Git","keywords":"","body":"Branching with Git\nThe first step in the GitHub Workflow is to create a branch. This will allow us to experiment with new features without accidentally introducing untested changes on our production branch.\nBranching Defined\n\nWhen you create a branch, you are essentially creating an identical copy of the project at that point in time. This isn't the same as creating a physical copy on disk. In the background, a branch is just a pointer.\nLet's learn how you can create a new branch.\nActivity: Creating A Branch with GitHub\nEarlier you created an issue about the file you would like to edit. Let's create the branch you will use to edit your file.\nFollow these steps to create a new branch in the class repository:\n\nYou will need to have collaborator access on the class repository before you can create a branch on GitHub.\n\n\nNavigate to Code tab of the class repository.\nClick the branch dropdown.\nEnter the branch name 'github-username-caption'.\nPress Enter.\n\nWhen you create a new branch on GitHub, you are automatically switched to your branch. Now, any changes you make to the files in the repository will be applied to this new branch.\n\nA word of caution. When you return to the repository or click the top level repository link, notice that GitHub automatically assumes you want to see the items on the default branch. If you want to continue working on a feature branch, you will need to reselect it using the branch dropdown.\n\nExploring\nHere are some interesting things you can check out later:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/H5GJfcp3p4Q A GitHub Training Video on branching.\n\n"},"05_local_git_configs.html":{"url":"05_local_git_configs.html","title":"Local Git Configs","keywords":"","body":"Local Git Configuration\nIn this section, we will prepare your local environment to work with Git.\nChecking Your Git Version\nFirst, let's confirm your Git Installation:\n$ git --version\n$ git version 2.11.0\n\nIf you do not see a git version listed or this command returns an error, you may need to install Git.\n\nTo get the latest version of Git, visit www.git-scm.com.\n\nGit Configuration Levels\n\nGit allows you to set configuration options at three different levels.\n--system\nThese are system-wide configurations. They apply to all users on this computer.\n--global\nThese are the user level configurations. They only apply to your user account.\n--local\nThese are the repository level configurations. They only apply to the specific repository where they are set.\n\nThe default value for git config is --local.\n\nViewing Your Configurations\nIf you would like to see which config settings have been added automatically, you can type git config --list. This will automatically read from each of the three config files and list the setting they contain.\n$ git config --list\n\nYou can also narrow the list to a specific configuration level by including it before the list option.\n$ git config --global --list\n\nConfiguring Your User Name and Email\nGit uses the config settings for your user name and email address to generate a unique fingerprint for each of the commits you create. You can't create commits without these settings:\n$ git config --global user.name \"First Last\"\n$ git config --global user.email \"you@email.com\"\n\nGit Config and Your Privacy\nThe instructions for this exercise use the --global flag when identifying your user.name and user.email configuration settings. If you are currently using a computer without a private, personal account, don't apply the --global flag. This way, the settings will only be stored in our assignment repository. If you work in another repository on this same computer, you will need to set these configuration options again. \n\nFor example:\ngit config user.email \"you@email.com\"\n\n\nYour name and email address will automatically be stored in the commits you make with Git. If you would like your email to remain private, GitHub allows you to generate a no-reply email address for your account. Click the Keep my email address private in the Settings > Emails section. After enabling this feature, you just need to enter the automatically generated ID+username@users.noreply.github.com when configuring your email.\n\nFor example:\ngit config --global user.email 18249274+githubteacher@users.noreply.github.com\n\n\nConfiguring autocrlf\n$ //for Windows users\n$ git config --global core.autocrlf true\n$ //for Mac or Linux users\n$ git config --global core.autocrlf input\n\nDifferent systems handle line endings and line breaks differently. If you open a file created on another system and do not have this config option set, git will think you made changes to the file based on the way your system handles this type of file.\n\nMemory Tip: autocrlf stands for auto carriage return line feed.\n\n"},"06_working_locally.html":{"url":"06_working_locally.html","title":"Working Locally","keywords":"","body":"Working Locally with Git\nUsing the command line, you can easily integrate Git into your current workflow.\nCreating a Local Copy of the repo\n\nBefore we can work locally, we will need to create a clone of the repository.\nWhen you clone a repository you are creating a copy of everything in that repository, including its history. This is one of the benefits of a DVCS like git - rather than being required to query a slow centralized server to review the commit history, queries are run locally and are lightning fast.\nLet's go ahead and clone the class repository to your local desktop.\n\nNavigate to the Code tab of the class repository on GitHub.\nClick Clone or download.\nCopy the clone URL to your clipboard.\nOpen your command line application.\nRetrieve a full copy of the repository from GitHub: git clone \nOnce the clone is complete, cd into the new directory created by the clone operation: cd \n\nOur Favorite Git command: git status\n$ git status\nOn branch gh-pages\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/gh-pages'.\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\ngit status is a command you will use often to verify the current state of your repository and the files it contains. Right now, we can see that we are on branch gh-pages, everything is up to date with origin/gh-pages and our working tree is clean.\nUsing Branches locally\n$ git branch\n\nIf you type git branch you will see a list of local branches.\n$ git branch --all\n$ git branch -a\n\nIf you want to see all of the branches, including the read-only copies of your remote branches, you can add the --all option or just -a.\n\nThe --all and -a are actually synonyms for the branch command. Git often provides a verbose and a short option.\n\nSwitching Branches\n$ git checkout \nTo checkout the branch you created online, type git checkout and the name of your branch. Git will provide a message that says you have been switched to the branch and it has been set up to track the same remote branch from origin.\n\nYou do not need to type remotes/origin in front of the branch - only the branch name. Typing remotes/origin in front of the branch name will put you in a detached HEAD state. We will learn more about that later, but for now just remember this is not a state we want to be in.\n\nActivity: Edit Your File\nNow it is time to put an image and a caption into your file:\n\nFind your file, named 2010-02-##-USERNAME.md.\nOpen your file in your favorite text editor.\nCopy and paste the image text into your file on line 6.\nOn line 7, add this text to center the file: {: .center}. \nOn lines 9 and 10, add code for your caption.\n ```\n CAPTION-HERE\n {: .fragment}\n ```\n\nSave your file.\n\n\nGit doesn't care how you work with your files locally. You can work in your favorite IDE or text editor, or you can use VIM through the command line. \nTo open your file from the command line, many IDEs and text editors offer shortcuts. For example, to open the project in Atom, you can use atom . and to open it in Visual Studio Code you can use code ..\n\nThe Two Stage Commit\nAfter you have created your file, it is time to create your first snapshot of the repository. When working from the command line, you will need to be familiar with the idea of the two stage commit.\n\nWhen you work locally, your files exist in one of four states. They are either untracked, modified, staged, or committed.\nAn untracked file is a new file that has never been committed.\nGit tracks these files, and keeps track of your history by organizing your files and changes in three working trees. They are Working, Staging (also called Index), and History. When we are actively making changes to files, this is happening in the working tree.\n\nTo add these files to version control, you will create a collection of files that represent a discrete unit of work. We build this unit in the staging area.\n\nWhen we are satisfied with the unit of work we have assembled, we will take a snapshot of everything in the staging area. This is called a commit.\n\nIn order to make a file part of the version controlled directory we will first do a git add and then we will do a git commit. Let's do it now.\n\nFirst, let's check the status of our working tree: git status\nMove the file from the working tree to the staging area: git add my-file.md\nLet's see what happened: git status\nNow let's take our first snapshot: git commit\nGit will open your default text editor to request a commit message. Simply type your message on the top line of the file. Any line without a # will be included in the commit message.\nSave and close the commit message\nLet's take another look at our repository status: git status\n\n\nGood commit messages should:\n\nBe short. ~50 characters is ideal.\nDescribe the change introduced by the commit.\nTell the story of how your project has evolved.\n\n\n"},"07_collaborating_on_code.html":{"url":"07_collaborating_on_code.html","title":"Collaborating on Code","keywords":"","body":"Collaborating on Your Code\nNow that you have made some changes in the project locally, let's learn how to push your changes back to the shared class repository for collaboration.\nPushing Your Changes to GitHub\n\nIn this case, our remote is GitHub.com, but this could also be your company's internal instance of GitHub Enterprise.\nTo push your changes to GitHub, you will use the command:\n$ git push\n\n\nWhen you push, you will be asked to enter your GitHub username and password. If you would like Git to remember your credentials on this computer, you can cache your credentials using:\n\nWindows: git config --global credential.helper wincred\nMac: git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain\n\n\nActivity: Creating a Pull Request\nPull Requests are used to propose changes to the project files. A pull request introduces an action that addresses an Issue. A Pull Request is considered a \"work in progress\" until it is merged into the project.\nNow that you have started to change your file, you will open a pull request to discuss the file with your team mates. Follow these steps to create a Pull Request in the class repository:\n\nClick the Pull Request tab.\nClick New Pull Request.\nIn the base dropdown, choose gh-pages\nIn the compare dropdown, choose your branch.\nType a subject line and enter a comment.\nUse markdown formatting to add a header and a checklist to your Pull Request.\nInclude one of the keywords: closes, fixes, or resolves followed by the issue number you created earlier to note which Issue the Pull Request should close. Example: This resolves #3\nClick Preview to see how your Pull Request will look.\nAssign the Pull Request to yourself.\nClick Create pull request.\n\n\nWhen you navigate to the class repository, you should see a banner at the top of the page indicating you have recently pushed branches, along with a button that reads Compare & pull request. This helpful button will automatically start the pull request process between your branch and the repository's default branch.\n\nExploring a Pull Request\nNow that we have created a Pull Request, let's explore a few of the features that make Pull Requests the center of collaboration:\nConversation view\nSimilar to the discussion thread on an Issue, a Pull Request contains a discussion about the changes being made to the repository. This discussion is found in the Conversation tab and also includes a record of all of the commits made on the branch as well as assignments, labels and reviews that have been applied to the pull request.\nCommits view\nThe commits view contains more detailed information about who has made changes to the files. Clicking each commit ID will allow you to see the changes applied in that specific commit.\nFiles changed view\nThe Files changed view allows you to see cumulative effect of all the changes made on the branch. We call this the diff. Our diff isn't very interesting yet, but as we make changes your diff will become very colorful.\nCode Review in Pull Requests\nTo provide feedback on proposed changes, GitHub offers three levels of commenting:\nGeneral Conversation\nYou can provide general comments on the Pull Request within the Conversation tab.\nLine Comments\nIn the files changed view, you can hover over a line to see a blue + icon. Clicking this icon will allow you to enter a comment on a specific line. These line level comments are a great way to give additional context on recommended changes. They will also be displayed in the conversation view.\nReview\nWhen you are making line comments, you can also choose to Start a Review. When you create a review, you can group many line comments together with a general message: Comments, Approve, or Request Changes. Reviews have special power in GitHub when used in conjunction with protected branches.\nActivity: Code Review\nOne of the best ways to ensure code quality is to make peer reviews a part of every Pull Request. Let's review your partner's code now:\n\nClick the Pull Request tab.\nUse the Author drop down to locate your partner's pull request.\nClick the Files Changed tab.\nHover over a single line in the file to see the blue +. Click the + to add a line comment.\nComment on the line and click Start review.\nRepeat these steps to add 2-3 comments on the file.\nClick Review in the top right corner.\nChoose whether to Approve or Request changes\nEnter a general comment for the review.\nClick Submit review\nClick the Conversation view to check out your completed review.\n\n"},"08_edit_on_github.html":{"url":"08_edit_on_github.html","title":"Editing on GitHub","keywords":"","body":"Editing Files on GitHub\nSince you created the pull request, you will be notified when someone adds a comment or a review.

A new commit will be added that shows the point when the two branches were merged together.\nSquash and merge: This option will take all of the commits on your branch and compress them into a single commit. The commit messages will be preserved in the extended commit message for the commit, but the individual commits will be lost.\nRebase and merge: This option will take all of the commits and replay them as if they just happened. This allows GitHub to perform a fast forward merge (and avoids the addition of the merge commit).\n\n\nUpdating Your Local Repository\nWhen you merged your Pull Request, you deleted the branch on GitHub, but this will not automatically update your local copy of the repository. Let's go back to our command line application and get everything in sync.\nFirst, we need to get the changes we made on GitHub into our local copy of the repository:\n\nStart by switching back to your default branch: git checkout gh-pages\nRetrieve all of the changes from GitHub: git pull\n\ngit pull is a combination command that retrieves all of the changes from GitHub and then updates the branch you are currently on to include the changes from the remote. The two separate commands being run are git fetch and git merge\nCleaning Up the Unneeded Branches\nIf you type git branch --all you will probably see that, even though you deleted your branch on the remote, it is still listed in your local copy of the repository, both as a local branch and as a read-only remote tracking branch. Let's get rid of those extra branches.\n\nTake a look at your local branches: git branch --all\nLet's see which branches are safe to delete: git branch --merged\nDelete the local branch: git branch -d \nTake another look at the list: git branch --all\nYour local branch is gone but the remote tracking branch is still there. Delete the remote tracking branch: git pull --prune\n\n\nAdding the --merged option to the git branch command allows you to see which branches do not contain unique work when compared to the checked out branch. In this case, since we are checked out to gh-pages, we will use this command to ensure all of the changes on our feature branch have been merged to production before we delete the branch.\n\nIf you would like pruning of the remote tracking branches to be set as your default behavior when you pull, you can use the following configuration option: git config --global fetch.prune true.\n"},"10_local_history.html":{"url":"10_local_history.html","title":"Local History","keywords":"","body":"Viewing Local Project History\nIn this section, you will discover commands for viewing the history of your project.\nUsing Git Log\nWhen you clone a repository, you receive the history of all of the commits made in that repository.

Work together to resolve the merge conflict.\n\nIn our class repository, create the branch that you will be working on and name it something memorable like USERNAME-conflict.\nOn your branch, create a new file. The file name must be the same file name that your partner uses. Make sure the content inside of the file is different, and that neither file is empty.\nCreate a pull request in the class repository with base: master and compare: USERNAME-conflict.\nYou will see that the first pull request can merge well.\nWhen you see the merge conflict in the second pull request, work together to resolve the merge conflict.\nWorking locally, merge master into the feature branch.\nWhen you see there's a conflict, that's OK!

In conjunction with CI, companies can move to a CD model by giving developers the freedom to deploy several times a day upon successful builds. Merging in and of itself isn't considered CD, unless it's tied to some deployment strategy (ex: Heroku automatically deploy anything that gets merged into master).\n\n\nWe will cover more CI than CD in this course.\nThough the concepts are different, CI and CD are frequently discussed and implemented together.\nTypically CI and CD are implemented at the same time because many of the tasks are already defined. For example, a project may already have the tests written, and the steps for deployment. Once a CI/CD tool is introduced, it's simple to have them be done together.\n\n\n\n\nOther Things to Think About\n\nProtected branches\nOn GitHub, you may want to set up protected branches when you set up CI/CD.\nProtected branches block code from being merged in to the master branch on the remote before it passes a set of configurable requirements, like passing CI/CD tests and builds, or having approved reviews.\n\n\nAutomatic deploys\nWith CI/CD, you can also set up deploys to happen automatically when code passes the tests on the master branch.\nMuch like many integrations work with GitHub, many deployment options work with CI/CD services.\nOne example is Heroku. You could configure a project on Heroku with a CI/CD service, and whenever a build passes on the master branch, deployment to Heroku would be streamlined and taken care of automatically.\n\n\n\n"},"32_setting_up_cicd.html":{"url":"32_setting_up_cicd.html","title":"Setting up CI/CD","keywords":"","body":"Setting Up CI/CD\nWe are going to start with tests built in to github-games.\n\nVisit the CI/CD integration site.\nWhen prompted to create a new account or log in, authenticate with GitHub.\nAdd a new project, selecting the github-games repository.

For example, you could use bisect to locate the commit where:\n\na bug was introduced.\na new feature was added.\na benchmark’s performance improved.\n\nHow it works\ngit bisect works by cutting the history between two points in half and then checking you out to that commit. You then check whether the bug/feature exists at that point and tell Git the result. From there, Git will do another division, etc until you have located the desired commit.\n\nWhen you are doing a bisect, you are essentially in a detached head state. It is important to remember to end the bisect with git bisect reset before attempting to perform other operations with Git.\n{: .warning}\n\nFinding the Bug in Our Project\nThe Long Way\n\nInitiate the binary search: git bisect start.\nSpecify the commit where you noticed the code was broken: git bisect bad .\nSpecify the commit where you knew things were working: git bisect good .\nBisect will check you out to the midpoint between good and bad.\nRun a test to see if the game would work at this point. Our test is to use ls to see if an index.html file exists.\nIf the game is still broken (there is no index.html file), type: git bisect bad.\nIf the game works (and there is an index.html file), type: git bisect good.\nGit will bisect again and wait for you to test. This will happen until Git has enough information to pinpoint the first bad commit.\nWhen Git has detected the error, it will provide a message that SHA is the first bad commit.\nExit the bisect process: git bisect reset.\n\nThe Short Way\nBisect can also run the tests on your code automatically. Let's try it again using a shortcut command and a test:\n\ngit bisect start  \ngit bisect run ls index.html\n\n"},"15_reverting_commits.html":{"url":"15_reverting_commits.html","title":"Reverting Commits","keywords":"","body":"Reverting Commits\nIn this section, we will learn about commands that re-write history and understand when you should or shouldn't use them.\nHow Commits Are Made\nEvery commit in Git is a unique snapshot of the project at that point in time.

Some service providers can automatically infer these settings based on your code, others require you to provide a detailed specification. These specifications are stored in the .yml file and are under version control just like the rest of your project.\n\nThe .yml is like a to-do list with three main parts:\n\nsetting up the environment\ntesting\ndeploying\n\nThere are many other steps that can go around and in between as a part of these main sections. If there are some scripts you want to occur prior to the build, as part of the build, or based on the output or results of a build or test(s), that is all possible. The content of the .yml file will vary between service providers and you should consult their documentation when crafting your .yml file.\n\nNote: Our examples are relatively simple, but the capabilities of the testing environment go much deeper. The purpose of these testing environments is to test as closely to production as possible. The sky is the limit, if you want to test multiple versions, languages, environments, or machines, it is all possible!
