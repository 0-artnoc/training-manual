= GitHub for Developers Training Manual

Welcome to the first edition of the GitHub for Developers Training Manual.

This project uses the Asciidoc format for the text of the manual. The manuals are generated using the `asciidoctor-pdf` project.

== How To Generate the Manual

Each manual supports two versions, a student version and a facilitator version. Select the version of the file you would like to generate by designating the appropriate theme and book as follows:

==== Student Manual
