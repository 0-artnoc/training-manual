# GitHub Training Manuals

Welcome to the GitHub Training Manual repo. In this repo, you will find the content for all of the materials used by GitHub trainers during our official training courses.

## How To Generate the Manuals

Each manual supports two versions, a student version and a facilitator version. To create both manuals for a given class,
run:

`script/generate-manual <manual-name>`

where `<manual-name>` is one of the `*.md` files in this project's root directory. If you want to generate the manuals for every class, run:

`script/setup`
