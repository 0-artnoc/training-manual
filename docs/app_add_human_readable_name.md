## Add your human-readable name

Adding your human-readable name to your profile enables people to find and @mention you without knowing your GitHub username. This can be especially helpful for repositories owned by an organization so other users can easily find you. It's important to note that your name may appear around GitHub where you contribute or are @mentioned. You can remove it at any time.
